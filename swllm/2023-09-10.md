 - a few experiments on comparing models

 - first: produce 500 word chunks of an input file. This is needed so
   that prompt size does not exceed context size for some models

```shell
(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ awk -v RS='[[:space:]]+' 'BEGIN{wordcount=0;chunkcount=1} {wordcount++; print $0} wordcount==500 {wordcount=0; chunkcount++}' < ~/tmp/workbench/aFewTextDocs/Schabas_2005_NaturalOriginsEconomics.txt | split -l 500 - output_chunk
```
 - the resulting chunk files are labeled output_chunkaa, _chunkab,
 etc. and have one word per line


 - the first two chunks were processed using a local llama2 model and
   the following prompt:
```shell
(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm templates show themeList
name: themeList
prompt: 'Write concise summary of the following text. Return response as a list of
    the themes in th\ e text. Text to summarize: $input

    '
```


   results:
```shell
(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m llama-2-7b-chat -t themeList < output_chunkaa                        
 Based on the provided text, the following are some of the themes that emerge:

1. The natural origins of economics: The author argues that economics is a science grounded in physical nature and not just a social construct.
2. Overlap between economic theory and natural sciences: The study examines the methodological and conceptual overlap between economic theory and the natural sciences, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding economic phenomena.
3. Denaturalization of the economic order: John Stuart Mill is identified as a pivotal figure in the process of denaturalizing the economic order by challenging the idea that economics is a separate discipline from other fields such as philosophy and politics.
4. Power of ideas: The text suggests that economists' and politicians' ideas, whether right or wrong, have more power than commonly understood, and everything we do is governed by the economy.
5. Limits of economic control: Despite the belief in controlling the economy through monetary and fiscal measures, paradoxically, as economies have become more complex, people have come to see every human activity in economic terms, leading to a greater embrace of the belief that we can control the economy.
6. Historical context of the concept of "the economy": The text notes that even though people have come to perceive everything they do as part of the economy, this perception is relatively recent and has grown in credibility over time. In contrast, earlier societies did not recognize an entity called the economy.ggml_metal_free: deallocating

(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m llama-2-7b-chat -t themeList < output_chunkab
 Here are the main themes present in the text:

1. The conception of wealth and its relationship with nature: The text explores how early modern thinkers viewed wealth as a property of the physical world, governed by natural laws, and how this view changed over time.
2. The distinction between natural and human phenomena: The author highlights how economic discourse was considered part of natural philosophy until the mid-nineteenth century, when it became distinct from natural processes and subject to human laws and agency.
3. The denaturalization of the economic domain: The text explains how political economists came to see the economic domain as severed from the physical world and under human control, a shift that occurred gradually over time.
4. Differences in worldviews between leading theorists: The author juxtaposes the conceptions of wealth articulated by Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, François Quesnay, and Alfred Marshall to illustrate how their views on wealth stemmed from different worldviews.ggml_metal_free: deallocating

- using the same prompt, but with the OpenAI gpt3.5-turbo-16k model
yields this result:

```shell
(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m chatgpt-16k -t themeList < output_chunkaa
Themes in the text:
1. The question of whether economics is a science
2. The overlap between economic theory and the natural sciences
3. The rise of mathematical economics in the late-nineteenth century
4. The conceptual foundations of classical economics
5. The denaturalization of the economic order by John Stuart Mill
6. The perception of "the economy" in modern times and its influence over daily life
7. The belief in controlling the economy through monetary and fiscal measures
8. The absence of the concept of "the economy" in earlier centuries
9. The focus on money, trade, and wealth in early modern political economy discussions
10. The limited use of the term "economies" in early modern thinking.

(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m chatgpt-16k -t themeList < output_chunkab
Themes in the text:

1. Conceptions of wealth: Early modern conceptions of wealth were focused on specific phenomena and equated wealth with physical resources such as plants and minerals. Wealth was seen as a property of the physical world.
2. Shift in economic theories: Over time, economic theorists began to view the economy as a distinct entity governed by human laws and agency, rather than natural processes. Economic discourse was considered part of natural philosophy, not a social science.
3. Denaturalization of the economic order: The economic domain was gradually seen as separate from the physical world and the product of human action, deliberation, and institutions. This denaturalization of the economic order was a gradual process that has not been fully completed.
4. Differences in conceptions of the economic realm: There were notable differences in the conception of the economic realm articulated by leading theorists in the 1770s compared to those in the 1870s. The differences stem from differing worldviews and perspectives on the mechanisms and sources of economic phenomena.
5. Views on nature: Different theorists had varying perspectives on nature, with some seeing it as wise, just, and benevolent, while others viewed it as imprudent, unjust, and cruel.
6. Definition of wealth: Different theorists also had different definitions of wealth, with some seeing it as a gift of nature and others defining it in terms of property claims and human institutions.

- using same prompt with OpenAI gpt4 model
yields this result:

```shell
(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m gpt4 -t themeList < output_chunkaa
- Understanding economics as a science
- The overlap of economic theory with the natural sciences
- The role of methodology and conceptual foundations in economics
- The rise of mathematical economics in the late 19th century Britain
- The influence of physical nature on the phenomena of classical economics
- The "denaturalization" of the economic order led by John Stuart Mill
- The pervasive influence of economy in everyday life
- The perception and understanding of 'the economy' in early modern times and its evolution over centuries
- The perceived command over the economy through monetary and fiscal measures
- The investigation into money, trade, and wealth as primary aspects of political economy.

(venv) beckett: ~/local/LLMS/swllm $ llm -m gpt4 -t themeList < output_chunkab
- Early economic theory viewed wealth as a natural concept, associated with physical elements of the earth and sea.
- The perception of wealth was linked to early ideals and religion, such as the Garden of Eden.
- During the late 18th and mid-19th centuries, economic theorists began to treat the economy as a separate entity influenced by human laws and actions.
- Economic phenomena were initially explained through analogies with natural phenomena and deemed part of natural philosophy, not separate social or human science.
- The separation of the economic realm from the natural world, known as "denaturalization," occurred gradually and isn't universally accepted.
- Leading economic theorists between the 1770s and 1870s had divergent views on the relationship between nature, wealth, and economic phenomena.
- Some early economists, such as Adam Smith and François Quesnay, viewed nature and wealth positively. In contrast, later economists like John Stuart Mill and Alfred Marshall saw nature more skeptically and wealth as tied to human-defined property rights.
