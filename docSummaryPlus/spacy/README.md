# README

2023-09-26: this folder holds some experiments using the NLP module
`spaCy`. I was led to `spaCy` by this post:
<https://medium.com/thoughts-on-machine-learning/spacy-llm-is-so-robust-do-we-still-need-langchain-ce7c3e3dbd8d>  

Two observations:  
1. the code in the gist does not work without a fair amount of
   futzing.  this includes a foray into the cool `typer` module. but
   in the end that just leads me back to using my usual command-line
   argument processing.  
2. `spaCy` seems like a very useful module to explore for my document
   summarization and topic classification and extraction notions. The
   documentation seems complete, but there is a
   to-be-determined-how-big learning curve. oh well.
