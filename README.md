# AI Praxis Laboratory  
## Practical action with AI and LLMs

- A repository to hold explorations and experiments with using AI and
LLMs.

- We try to keep the labs and benches clean, but there is always a chance that unfinished work is left lying around.  Also, there is no guarantee that what is here today will be here tomorrow.

- Comments and bug reports are welcome at <https://github.com/band/aipraxisLab/issues>, and I'm happy to review pull requests.

## Working practices:  
 - Each folder contains its own Python `venv` directory. My working
   practice is to activate a virtual environment  
   (`$ source venv/bin/activate`)  
   in each folder before running any code and deactivating when done.  

 - Each folder may contain a context-specific README.md Notes.md files

- There is a [[Laboratory Project Notebook]] to collect and organize development notes and observations.  

## localGPT  

- The lab bench for experiments using local LLMs (and not needing an
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  
## docSummaryPlus

- The lab bench for experiments and explorations into document
  summarization and Q&A

## workbench  

- assorted code fragments and experiment materials
